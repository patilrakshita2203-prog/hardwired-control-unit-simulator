# 🖥️ Interactive Hardwired Control Unit Simulator

An educational **Hardwired Control Unit Dashboard** built for ADLD students to visualize how CPU control signals work in real time.

This simulator demonstrates how a processor executes instructions using **hardwired logic** instead of microprogramming.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Hardwired CU Simulator** provides an interactive environment to understand:

- Instruction execution flow  
- Control signal activation  
- Register and memory interactions  
- CPU datapath visualization  
- Pipeline-style micro-operations  

This project is designed as a **real-time teaching tool**, not just a textbook diagram.
